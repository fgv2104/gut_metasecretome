# Characterization and biogeography of the healthy human gut metasecretome
Part of a msystems publication [link here]

We annotated MAGs from the Nayfach et al 2019 study [link here] using SignalP, TMHMM, and eggNOG to obtain a dataset of putative gut secreted proteins. Using Elinav et al study [link here] we mapped metagenomic reads from biopsies taken along the gastrointestical tract to our secreted gut proteins reference and inferred the gastrointestinal sublocalization of secreted protein functions.
